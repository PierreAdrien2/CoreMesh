IERenderer.exe is an executable file associated with Pegasus Mail, a widely used email client developed by David Harris. The version 2.0.0.8 of this software is designed to handle the rendering of HTML content within emails, ensuring that users can view messages in their intended format. Generally, IERenderer.exe is considered safe when it is sourced from the official Pegasus Mail installation, as it is a legitimate component of the software and not a virus or malware. However, like any executable file, it can be susceptible to issues such as errors or conflicts with other software, which may lead to performance problems or crashes. Users should ensure that their antivirus software is up to date and perform regular scans to rule out the possibility of infections that might masquerade as IERenderer.exe, especially if the file is located outside of its usual directory or if there are signs of unusual behavior on their system.
